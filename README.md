# Compendium
My ever growing library and collection of technical documentation (both self-written and acquired material)

Table of Contents:
- Applications (documentation/information about various applications, standalone/container/turnkey/etc.)
- Builds (higher level then Systems usually, working at the physical hardware layer, likely also involving OS and Application layer as too)
- Graveyard (documents on items I no longer maintain/support, moved here for archival purposes, should they be resurrected)
- Languages (everything I've collected about a certain computer language)
- Media (for my side quests of exploring compression through various media codecs)
- Systems (higher level then Applications, working at the OS layer)
